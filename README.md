Description and rule of game:
ENGG1340 Adventure is a turn-based, text-based game where multiple players can choose their roles (fighter/mage/support) and use various skills to fight against boss --- ENGG1340Fail.

Different roles have different skills. The following is a brief introduction of each role:
1.	fighter
feature: Making a lot of damage
defect: No skill to recover mp (magic point) or hp (health point)

2.	mage
feature: Recover mp
defect: No skill to recover hp and damage to boss is low

3.	support
feature: Recover hp and provide shield for players
defect: No skill to recover mp and damage to boss is very low
*shield could prevent players from bossâ€™s next hit

When a player does not have enough mp to use some skill, using that skill will automatically skip that round.

Hence, teamwork is needed in OC dmx, different roles could make the most of themselves only with their team members.

The game is full of randomness. The damage or healing value of some skills is generated randomly within a range, and there are two buff and two debuff that player have chance to get each round, the following is buff & debuff included.
Buff included: 
	1. ALL players recover 500hp.   
	2. ALL players' mp become double
